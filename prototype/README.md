# Prototype code for OncoBlocks Data Block

## About

This directory contains prototype code for the OncoBlocks Data Block.  It is intended as a sandbox to try out new ideas.

## Current Status of Prototype

The prototype is currently very simple.  It stores mutation data to MongoDB and then makes the data available a few simple JSON web services.

## Prerequisites

* http://www.mongodb.com/:  you must download, and install mongoDB.  Once installed, run as daemon:  

		mongod

## Proxy server
If you working with a proxy server then you need to set your proxy settings for maven.Help <a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-proxies.html">link</a>.

## Running Unit Tests

Run:
	mvn test
	
## Loading up Sample Data

The data folder contains a trivial set of data files:

* TCGA_codes.txt:  currently only contains TCGA Ovarian cancer.
* human_genes.txt:  currently only contains info for one gene:  TTN.
* ov_tcga.maf.txt:  currently only contains somatic mutations for TTN.

To load this data, run:

	./init.sh

## Addition to pom.xml 
Add java version to your pom.xml:
```
	<properties>
		.
		<maven.compiler.source>1.7</maven.compiler.source>
		<maven.compiler.target>1.7</maven.compiler.target>
		.
	</properties>
```


## Accessing the Web Services

Once you have loaded the sample data, run:

	mvn tomcat:run
		
Sample queries:

* [Get Gene Info for TTN](http://localhost:8080/oncoblocks/webservice.do?query=get_gene&gene_symbol=TTN)
* [Get list of Cancer Studies within the Block](http://localhost:8080/oncoblocks/webservice.do?query=get_cancer_studies)
* [Get all mutations involving TTN](http://localhost:8080/oncoblocks/webservice.do?query=get_mutations&entrez_id=7273)
* [Get all mutations associated with case ID:  TCGA-25-1322](http://localhost:8080/oncoblocks/webservice.do?query=get_mutations&case_id=TCGA-25-1322)
